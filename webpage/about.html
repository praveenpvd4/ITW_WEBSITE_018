            <p>Messi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, the third of four children of Jorge Messi, a steel factory manager, and his wife Celia 
                Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. On his father's side, he is of Italian and Spanish descent, 
                the great-grandson of immigrants from the northcentral Adriatic Marche region of Italy and Catalonia, and on his mother's 
                side, he has primarily Italian ancestry.[4][12] Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, "Leo" developed a
                 passion for the sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and Mat√≠as, and his cousins,
                  Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi, both of whom became professional footballers.[13] At the age of four he joine
                  d local club Grandoli, where he was coached by his father, though his earliest influence as a player came from his
                   maternal grandmother, Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches.[14] He was greatly affected by her death, 
                   shortly before his eleventh birthday; since then, as a devout Catholic, he has celebrated his goals by looking up and 
                   pointing to the sky in tribute of his grandmother.[15][16]
