                     <p>Messi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, the third of four children of Jorge Messi, a steel factory manager, 
                         and his wife Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. On his father's side,

                    <h1>Barcelona</h1>
                    <p>During the 2003–04 season, his fourth with Barcelona, Messi rapidly progressed through the club's ranks,
                         debuting for a record five youth teams in a single campaign.[33] After being named player of the
                          tournament in four international pre-season competitions with the Juveniles B, he played only one official 
                          match with the team before being promoted to the Juveniles A, where he scored 18 goals in 11 league games.
                          [34][35] Messi was then one of several youth players called up to strengthen a depleted first team during the international break.
                           French winger Ludovic Giuly explained how a teenage Leo caught the eye in a training session with Frank Rijkaard's first team:

                    <p>As a dual Argentine-Spanish national, Messi was eligible to play for the national team of both countries.[301]
                         Selectors for Spain's Under-17 squad began pursuing him in 2003 after Barcelona's director of football, Carles Rexach,
                          alerted the Royal Spanish Football Federation to their young player. Messi declined the offer, 
                          having aspired to represent La Albiceleste since childhood.

                    <p>Since 2008, Messi has been in a relationship with Antonella Roccuzzo, a fellow native of Rosario.[514] 
                        He has known Roccuzzo since he was five years old, as she is the cousin of his best friend since childhood, 
                        Lucas Scaglia, who is also a football player.[515] After keeping their relationship private for a year, 
                        Messi first confirmed their romance in an interview in January 2009, before going public a month later during a carnival in Sitges
                         after the Barcelona–Espanyol derby.
